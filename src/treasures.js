It appears to be carrying two different types of berries! They must be a rare species of fruit. Both have odd traits. One seems to be a suppressant, while the other is a stimulant. It's not easy to tell which is which. I'd better be careful with them. I should also warn Louie, or else he may try to bake these berries in a pie.", salesPitch: "Fate's tapestry has unraveled. Tomorrow weeps. Romance has fallen, love is madness. ...To mend the rift between two cross lovers, this is the ultimate weapon in Cupid's arsenal."},

The skies cleared up, and I felt peaceful watching the pink flower petals flutter in the wind. During this perilous expedition, it seems strange to have such softhearted, romantic thoughts. If I told my wife about this, I'm sure I'd get laughed at...again.", salesPitch: "This fruit is born of bright sunlight and cheerful warmth. Come, all you gloomy naysayers! One bite and even sad sacks will become foolhardy optimists. Eat one today and change your life!"},

To make up for the ship's shortcomings, I'm making a special effort to try everything.", salesPitch: "Everything is best in moderation. This fruit is the perfect example of too much of a good thing. Its devastating sweetness is like an act of violence on the palate, scouring all with succulence..."},

The creatures there have had to battle hard to survive in this unforgiving landscape. That's probably why they've evolved such an ill temper. For instance, this plant's berries suck the nutrition from the surrounding flora!", salesPitch: "This item's docile efficiency evokes images of wealth and greed. Behold:  life's essence!"},

If we could cultivate these ample fruits on Hocotate, nobody would ever go hungry again! Sadly, I don't know anything about agriculture. Maybe I should have listened to my wife when she told me to do yard work...", salesPitch: "Fruits cannot be judged by their outer coverings, no matter how hairy. This one is quite yummy. It is times like these that make me wish I were equipped with advanced taste capabilities."},

The ship can't stand to even look at these pests, let alone store them. But I had to put my foot down on this one.", salesPitch: "Awash in color and sugars, this item makes an ideal home for many insect species. I am sure this is valuable to the scientific community, but it has little value as a commodity."},

It appears that the fruit's thick skin protected it from the frigid cold... It's quite remarkable. The shape of the fruit eerily resembles the president's head. PS:  The labyrinthine underground entrails of this planet are like a completely different world.", salesPitch: "The thick, acidic rind of this item is proof positive of its highly elevated mental functions. When I assess it, I am somehow reminded of a particularly hateful superior. Hurry up and devour it!"},
    {number: 8, name: "Spiny Alien Treat", series: "Nature's Candy Series", seriesNumber: 2, realWorldObject: "Artichoke", location: "Valley of Repose", value: 50, weight: 4, maxCarriers: 8, buried: "completely", olimarNotes: "The Valley of Repose is blanketed with a layer of snow.

When carrying fallen creatures or pellets, Pikmin will take them to the Onion of their same color. If a mixed crew of Pikmin are carrying spoils, the color majority dictates the destination. Carry pellets to same-colored Onions to maximize Pikmin seed production.", salesPitch: "A quick-growing plant. Good for garden hobbyists or for a snack. Use it however you see fit!"},

Is the feeling love...or hallucination?"},

However, this analysis was done by a machine, so I'm not completely convinced. Normally I wouldn't mind trying it myself, but I haven't been feeling well since I ate that toxic berry...", salesPitch: "A vegetable with spiciness beyond description. None want to eat it, so it must be healthy! Nutrition-conscious people of today! Numb your palate and eat!"},

However, I bet Louie would try a bite. His appetite is insatiable...and he's always cooking up tasty meals! I'm glad that on this expedition, our ship's reactor can power our life-support systems indefinitely. This will give us all the time we need to thoroughly examine all of the treasure we recover. I don't care if the president wants us to hurry. I've had enough of his hassling! I think I'll move more slowly just to cause him indigestion.", salesPitch: "This poisonous mushroom is so malicious, I cannot even bear to look at it! This fatal fungus overflows with venom and is perilous indeed..."},

I'd like to field-test one of these babies. I wonder what would happen if I fed one to a purple Pikmin...", salesPitch: "Eat one of these and grow to twice your normal size! Perfect for skinny beings unable to pack on any girth."},
    {number: 16, name: "Onion Replica", series: "Nature's Candy Series", seriesNumber: 2, realWorldObject: "Onion", location: "Perplexing Pool", value: 30, weight: 20, maxCarriers: 30, buried: "completely", olimarNotes: "This looks just like one of Hocotate's famous sweet onions!

When I entered the atmosphere on my descent from space, I was stunned by the vibrant sight. The other day, a group of white Pikmin under my command detected an object buried under the surface and immediately began to dig up this colossal flower bulb. Somehow, it hadn't yet sprouted into a towering flower. I plan to take it back to Hocotate and grow it there! My people will hail me as a botanical genius...and the mayor may even make me Supreme Flower Commander!", salesPitch: "Life finds a way across galaxies. Can a plant from a primitive planet take root in Hocotate's soil? Won't you invest in this romantic pursuit?"},

I just think it looks and feels like a soft blanket. In the interest of scientific discovery, I'd better give it a test run...", salesPitch: "Perfect for those who love natural designs in their home, this leaf applique is a bargain! Use it in pieces, or cover an entire wall in leafiness!"},

This time, I must find and rescue Louie! I've been scouring the wilderness we landed on. As I scour this region, I can't help but feel lonely for my faithful sidekick. Even if he does eat all of the ship's onboard snacks. Because of my loneliness, I've dubbed this rough region the Wistful Wild.", salesPitch: "Life is full...but short! Is this one of those short-lived life-forms that changes shape as it ages? Even though it is dried out, it has not lost its unique charm."},

I've made it my personal quest to solve all of the universe's ancient mysteries.", salesPitch: "Think you can eat it all? Then start eating! That is the goal this giant piece of meat incites. It has just the right texture... And a thick slab of fat that will make all gourmets, epicures, kings of the table, and queens of the buffet howl with delight. Or so I have assessed..."},

That huge creature had a habit of dragging away treasures and hoarding them in its den. I wonder if there's a way to use these creatures to aid my treasure-seeking mission... On second thought, that's a bad idea. Pikmin are the only creatures I can really rely on.", salesPitch: "The consistency of the half-cooked yolk says \"Mmm! Good!\" It is packed with nutrients, too. I can sell it, but I have never eaten it. I am UNABLE to eat it. Not even a nibble."},

For instance, this is the first time I've tasted this, yet it has a nostalgic taste. It's inexplicable! It tastes like something my mom has made for me by hand.", salesPitch: "In this modern world of artificial foods, all things taste the same, despite your dear tongue buds. If that describes you, then this is for you. Its flavor is the balm to heal your wounded soul!"},

Well, to be honest... If there are any within reach, I can't help myself! Strangely, Pikmin never eat snacks. I wonder where all of their energy comes from?", salesPitch: "This will satisfy any sweet tooth! It begins with savory softness, then fills the mouth with fluffs of flavor, and finally overwhelms with a river of sweetness. It is a three-pronged tongue assault!"},

I can't allow my bad attitude to erode teamwork on this vital mission.", salesPitch: "It is hard. Really hard. Too hard. So hard that you're not sure you can eat it, even though you must.

Pure, undeniable sweetness; unavoidable tooth decay. Who cares? Enjoy the here and now!"},
